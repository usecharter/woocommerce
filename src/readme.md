## About Charter

Charter is an AI-powered ad-budget optimization platform.

As a B2B SaaS startup, Charter provides its customers with a proprietary algorithm that optimizes and automates ad budgets across platforms, helping them achieve the maximum possible ROI with minimal effort.

Key features of Charter include:
- The ability to group campaigns into shared budgets, allowing the algorithm to reallocate spend to maximize a target metric set for the group.
- Scaling campaign budgets up to their saturation point when they are profitable or meet performance thresholds, and scaling them down when they are unprofitable or fall short of set performance thresholds.
- Protecting against campaigns going back into the learning phase due to budget changes.
- Offering fully automated ad budgeting or budget change suggestions for customers to review.
